# Title
waitlist-app-backend

## Project Idea
A simple waitlist subscription app that allows users to sign up for a waitling list with their email address. There is no need to register. The only file dprovided is the email address. When a user submits the waitlist entry is created with a status set to 'pending' and a createdAt property is set automatically to the current date. Also a confirmation token is generated and added to the waitlist entry. When the entry was created, an email is sent to the user's email address including the confirmation token. A confirmation endpoint accepts the token and sets the waitlist entry status to 'confirmed' if the token matches an existing entry. Upon confirmation a second email is sent to the recipient confirming the waitlist entry. A waitlist entry can be set to status 'removed' through another endpoint where only the email address needs to be specified.
